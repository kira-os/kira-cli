## Ideas

- [2025-10-11] Local webserver to give non-technical folk a GUI to visualize the state of the system and make changes.

- [2025-10-11] Kira should be able to create a static read only version of the GUI that can be hosted on github pages, s3, gitlab pages, etc.

- [2025-10-11] Kira should have commands that make it easy to include as git submodules in other projects.

- [2025-10-11] Kira should be able to organize wiki pages in a similar way to work items.

- [2025-10-11] Kira init should offer to add a reference to the AGENTS.md file so agents know how to use the tool. Kira agent-reference command could be used to generate the reference also. The reference should be a markdown file called KIRA.md

- [2025-10-11] kira.yml should sit outside of the .work directory and be a single file that contains all the configuration for the tool. If kira is managing docs we would want that in a separate folder called .docs.

- [2025-10-11] Kira should be able to generate a list of all the work items in a given status.

- [2025-10-11] Kira should be able to import data from Jira.
